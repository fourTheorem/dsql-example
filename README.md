# DSQL Example

An example API backend using Amazon Aurora DSQL âœ¨.
t
This report provides everything you need to deploy and load-test an API using a Amazon DSQL PostgreSQL backend.

## Features

- [Fastify](https://fastify.dev/) API backend using AWS Lambda and [Drizzle ORM](https://drizzle.team)
- API Gateway REST API
- OpenAPI specification
- Load test script
- CDK Infrastructure

## Prerequisites

- A recent [AWS CLI](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/getting-started-install.html) version that supports DSQL (`aws dsql`).
- Node.js 22 or later
- (Optional) - A PostgreSQL `psql` client - https://www.postgresql.org/download/.

## Deployment

The CDK application provides two stacks:

- [DsqlExampleStack](./cdk/stacks/dsql-example-stack.ts) - provisions the DSQL cluster
- [ApplicationStack](./cdk/stacks/application-stack.ts) - provisions the API and Lambda backend

```shell
cd cdk
npm install
npx cdk deploy --all
```

The application should deploy and print the **stack outputs**, including `ApplicationStack.apiEndpoint`.
Set this to `BASE_URL` in your shell environment. We'll use it later when you run load tests!

```shell
export BASE_URL=https://<REST_API_ID>.execute-api.<REGION>.amazonaws.com/prod
```

## Creating the Database Schema

To create the database schema, we are going to use [Drizzle Kit](https://orm.drizzle.team/docs/kit-overview).
DSQL does not support the `SERIAL` data type used for incremental Drizzle migrations, so we'll just use the `push` command to create the entire schema.

```shell
npm install
cd packages/db

# Set the PostgreSQL connection string
export DATABASE_URL=$(npx tsx ./packages/cli/cli.ts)

npx drizzle-kit push
```

## Exporing the Database using `psql`

One option to connect to your database is to use AWS Cloudshell. For instructions on how to do this, and other connection examples, see https://docs.aws.amazon.com/aurora-dsql/latest/userguide/getting-started.html.

A helper script used by CloudShell is also provided here so you can connect using `psql`. It uses the AWS CLI to generate an IAM auth token for your connection.

```shell
./bin/dsql-connect --hostname DSQL_HOST --region eu-west-1 --database postgres --username admin
```
You'll need to replace `DSQL_HOST` with your cluster endpoint address. This is printed as a CloudFormation output (`DsqlExampleStack.endpoint`) when you run `cdk deploy` as instructed above.


## Running a Load Test

An excellent way of generating API load is using [k6](https://k6.io/).
You will need to follow the instructions to install `k6` locally.
Once that's done, you can run the default load test which simulates 100 virtual users (VUs) over a period of one minute.

```shell
k6 run ./test/load/full-api-test.js
```


If you are feeling more ambitious and don't mind spending a bit more on Lambda, API Gateway, Data Transfer, X-Ray or DSQL cost, you can increase the number of virtual users like this.

1,000 virtual users over two minutes:
```shell
k6 run ./test/load/full-api-test.js --vus 1000 --duration 2m
```
